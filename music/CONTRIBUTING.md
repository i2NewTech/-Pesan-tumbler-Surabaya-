# Contributing to @magenta/music

ðŸŽ‰ Before anything, thanks for taking the time to contribute! We really appreciate it!
We welcome contributions in all forms - either from opening issues or pull requests,
no matter how small (even if it's just fixing a typo!). So, thanks! ðŸ™ŒðŸ’•

This document should help you set up your environment for any local development and
hopefully help you pick something to work on.

### Contributor License Agreement

You might notice our friendly neighbourhood CLA-bot commenting on a pull request you
open if you haven't yet signed our CLA. We use the same CLA for all open-source
Google projects, so you only have to sign it once. Once you complete the CLA,
all your pull-requests will automatically get the `cla: yes` tag.

If you've already signed a CLA but still getting nags from the bot, it's possible
you signed it under a different username/email address. Check the [information on your CLA](https://cla.developers.google.com/clas) or see this help article on [setting the email on your git commits](https://
