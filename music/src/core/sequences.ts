// Set the quantization cutoff.
// Note events before this cutoff are rounded down to nearest step. Notes
// above this cutoff are rounded up to nearest step. The cutoff is given as a
// fraction of a step.
// For example, with quantize_cutoff = 0.75 using 0-based indexing,
// if .75 < event <= 1.75, it will be quantized to step 1.
// If 1.75 < event <= 2.75 it will be quantized to step 2.
// A number close to 1.0 gives less wiggle room for notes that start early,
// and they will be snapped to the previous step.
